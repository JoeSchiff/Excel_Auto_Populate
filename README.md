The output can be of various lengths and repeated indefinitely:

### Tested on:
Microsoft Excel 2016 and LibreOffice Calc 7.1.4.2.\
Since Excel uses an exclamation mark to designate a sheet name and LibreOffice Calc uses a period, I supplied two versions in the "spreadsheets" directory.

Use the .xlsx format if you're using Excel.


<br/><br/>
#### Why not use VBA?
You can and should, if you want to use this technique only at one specific location. An example of this is located at "spreadsheets/vba_alt.xlsm". However, I was not able to figure out a way to have my VBA method apply to all cells in a column while also preserving the format I wanted to use.

## Detailed description

The following sections provide a walkthrough for recreating this woorkbook's functionality. However, I strongly suggest using the "simple_example" workbooks I have provided (rather than starting from scratch) and modifying them to suit your needs.

MS Excel: spreadsheets/simple_example.xlsx\
LibreOffice Calc: spreadsheets/simple_example.ods


<br/><br/>
#### Overview
This example uses 4 industries. Each industry has a unique list of parameters associated with it. The number of parameters in each list varies (between 3 and 14).

What we want is to select an industry from a dropdown list and have Excel automatically populate adjacent cells with the appropriate parameters for that industry. 

Our workbook will have 3 sheets. The first (named sample_log) will be where we select the industry from a dropdown list. The second sheet (named iu_param_table) will be where we store the table that contains all the industries and their parameters. The third sheet (named get_param) will be where we put all the logic of our formulas. The sample_log sheet will have cells referencing the get_param sheet, so that whatever result we get on the get_param sheet will also display on the sample_log sheet.



<br/><br/>
#### Create the industry and parameter table
To get started we are going to put all of the industries and parameters on a separate sheet, so that it is out of the way. We are going to name this sheet "iu_param_table".


<br/><br/>
#### Create the industry dropdown list
Now we are going to create a dropdown list using data validation. The list will consist of all of the industry names.

To create a dropdown list click on the Data section (on the ribbon), then Data Validation. Select list and the source. The source is where all the names of the industries are located in the workbook. Ex: iu_param_table!B2:E2



<br/><br/>
#### Alright, now the fun part. The basic order of events for our formulas will be:
1. Get the industry name
2. Find that industry name in the table and return the column letter
3. Count the total number of rows (parameters) for that column
4. Count down (decrement) from step 3
5. Lookup the parameter using the number from step 4 and the column from step 2. 
<br/>
Many of these steps can be combined, but I chose to keep them separate in order to make it simpler to follow along.


<br/><br/>
### 1. Get the industry name

This is an easy one. Get the industry from the sample_log sheet. If the corresponding cell from the sample_log sheet is empty, then leave blank.

`=IF(sample_log!B3="", "", sample_log!B3)`



<br/><br/>
### 2. Find that industry name in the table and return the column letter

Use the MATCH function and supply it with the industry name and the table from the sheet named "iu_param_table". The trailing zero specifies an exact match.
However, the MATCH function returns a number to designate the position in the table. Instead, we want the column letter for the sheet. By adding 65 to the result and converting it with the CHAR function, we get the appropriate column letter. If you don't start your table on column B then you will need to use a number different than 65.

If the cell from step 1 is blank, then repeat what is in the cell above.

`=IF(B3="", C2, CHAR(65+MATCH(B3, iu_param_table!$B$2:$O$2, 0)))`



<br/><br/>
### 3. Count the total number of rows (parameters) for that column

Now we can count the number of items in that column. This will allow us to make our own FOR loop using something similar to a coordinate system. It will work like this:
Column 3, row 3
Column 3, row 4
Column 3, row 5
(until we reach a blank cell)

To do that, we supply the COUNTA function with a range of cells; the appropriate column starting at row 3 (that's where the data begins) until row 16 (where the data ends for the longest column in the table. If your data has more items, then increase this number).
This is what we are trying to achieve after the data has been evaluated:
`COUNTA(C3:C16)`

We are referencing column C in the above example from cell C3 (step 2) by using the INDIRECT function. Since the table is on another sheet we must also supply that by stating "iu_param_table!"

This is the formula we will actually use:

`=IF(sample_log!B3="", "", COUNTA(INDIRECT("iu_param_table!"&C3 & 3):INDIRECT("iu_param_table!"&C3 & 16)))`

<br/>
Now we have the number of parameters for that column.




<br/><br/>
### 4. Count down from step 3

This step will be used to loop through all the parameters. Weâ€™ll start with the number supplied from the previous column and decrement it until we reach zero (no parameters remaining).

`=IF(E7="", "", IF(ISNUMBER(D8), D8, IF(E7-1>0, E7-1, "")))`




<br/><br/>
### 5. Lookup the parameter using the number from step 4 and the column letter from step 2

We are using the column letter supplied by cell C3 and the row number supplied by E3. We have to add 2 to it because the data in the table starts on row 3. Again, we are using the INDIRECT function to refer to the sheet named "iu_param_table".

`=IF(ISNUMBER(E3), INDIRECT("iu_param_table!"&C3&E3+2), "")`

And finally this should give a parameter for that industry. Use AutoFill to extend these formulas to the cells below. Each row will contain a different parameter for that industry, until no more remain. 




<br/><br/>
### Display the results on the sample_log sheet
Paste this into the cell next to the industry that we selected on the "sample_log" sheet. Extend the formula into the rows below using the AutoFill feature. If your data on the sample_log sheet doesn't start on row 3 then adjust accordingly. 

`=get_param!F3`



<br/><br/>
Optional: 
You may notice that column C of sheet "get_param" has data extending down for all the rows that contain formulas. Unfortunately, there is no easy way of preventing this (due to circular logic errors) without making this example even more complicated. 

I will supply a full version of the workbook I used for this example. It contains slightly different formulas, which prevent that column letter from repeating forever.
